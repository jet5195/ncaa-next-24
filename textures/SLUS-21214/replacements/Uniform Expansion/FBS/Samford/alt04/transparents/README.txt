INSTRUCTIONS: 

This transparents folder is for any textures that you make transparent to disable them in the game. For example, if you don't want to have pride stickers on the helmet, make the 'pridesticker.png' texture that you put in 'put_exported_textures_in_here' transparent. Then, after it is renamed by the script and put in the root of the 'renamed' folder, move that file into the respective folder in this directory so we know what it is in case we want to enable it again down the road.
